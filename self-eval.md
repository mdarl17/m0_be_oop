# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

A: I felt pretty good about the classes assignment. I did have a couple questions about whether we needed both write and read access (didn't explicitly say so in instructions, but I was curious about real-world best practices. I would think write access using attr_write or attr_accessor might be a bit dangerous to allow write access unless absolutely necessary (need to be dynamic or not)). I have worked with classes in JavaScript and it's somewhat similar. Initially, however, I was expecting to be able to access any method or attribute in the class without needing to include the accessor methods or by making explicit getter and setter instance methods. I couldn't understand why I kept getting the 'NoMethodError' until I did a little research re: ruby classes and variable scope

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

A: I've been pretty good about taking at least 10 minutes every 45 minutes. Sometimes I push it if I feel I can keep going and be productive. I should probably do this less, however, if I want to be most productive. I like the material and find it interesting, so I haven't had much trouble staying focused and engaged.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

A: That accessor methods or explicit getter/setter methods are necessary for object instances to read or to write/update specific property values. I would like to see more object blueprints to determine best practices for writing instance methods vs. class methods.
